# Mailchimp boilerplate with repeatable blocks

This MailChimp HTML email boilerplate contains useful repeatable blocks with `mc:repeatable` and `mc:edit` attributes. 

Imported as a MailChimp Template it gives authors the opportunity to create, duplicate and rearrange different sections in a newsletter. 

Check this [sized screenshot](src/preview.png) with all available blocks.

Included:

- 1 column text
- 2 columns text
- Action button
- Banner + optional caption
- 2 columns thumbnails + text
- Image + text column (right or left aligned)
- All the above with inset & background
- Calendar + text (right or left aligned)

The boilerplate is used as a starting point for MailChimp templates at [spatie.be](https://spatie.be).

### Caveats

- Use images with the exact size. Outlook 2013 doesn't handle the `max-width` styles, larger images break the layout.
- Use line-heights in %, eg. `line-height: 150%`
- Caution with importing custom webfonts in Outlook 2013: they tend to break the font stack. Include conditional styles with `!important` to avoid Times New Roman / serif body text.

```html
<!--[if mso 15]>
<style type="text/css">
    h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6,
    .headerCell, .footerCell,
    .textContent, .textContentLast,
    .buttonContent,
    .emailCalendarDay, .emailCalendarMonth {
        font-family: Arial, sans-serif !important;
        mso-line-height-rule: exactly;
    }
</style>
<![endif]-->
```
